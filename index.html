          <p class="lead"></p>
          <hr class="my-4">
          <p>My name is Michael Gain. I currently attend Cabarrus Early College of Technology and Rowan-Cabarrus Community College. 
            I will receive my High School Diploma as well as an Applied Associates of Computer Programming.</p>

          <p>I love programming and everything computers. I have done a lot of programming in languages such as C++, C#, Python, 
            JavaScript/TypeScript, and Visual Basic. I also do a little HTML and CSS. C# has quickly become my favorite language 
            to use because of its flexibility and versatility. Programming is perfect for me because I love to come up with an idea 
            and actually make it a reality.</p>
            
          <p>If I'm not programming I'm probably playing video games. My favorite game is Skyrim and it is my biggest inspiration for 
            wanting to develop video games as a career. My interest in programming goes back a few years before with Minecraft. Seeing 
            all the amazing mods that people could create inspired me to learn how to program.</p>
