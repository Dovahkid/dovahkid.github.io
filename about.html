		<h2>About</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3><span>Why does this site exist?<span></h3>
		<p>
			This website was created to prove one of my former teachers wrong. (I'm a bit petty)
		</p>

		<h3><span>So whats the problem?<span></h3>
		<p>
			Growing up in the internet age my teachers always gave us guidelines on what websites could and could not be trusted.
			Some of these guidelines were alright such as .edu and .gov are generally more trustworthy.
			One of these guidelines that always bothered me is that .org websites are also more trustworthy.
		</p>

		<p>
			I can't stress enough how wrong that is. I, a random 17 year old, bought this .org for $12.
			When I first told my teacher that there was nothing stopping any random Joe from buying a .org
			she responded with, "You must be illegally buying it then!"
			...Ms. [REDACTED] I don't think Google would illegally sell anyone anything. (Well atleast not this blatantly)
		</p>

		<p>
			What she didn't understand was that top level domains (.com, .net, .org, etc.) are just guidelines, they are not laws.
			The only top level domains that are regulated are .edu and .gov. There may be more than those 2 but .org is not one of them.
			If all guidelines were enforced then only commericial entites could used .com and only service providers could used .net.
		</p>

		<h3><span>Whats the solution then?<span></h3>
		<p>
			Alright I hear you saying, "Then how do I know if a website is reliable?" Its pretty simple actually, use common sense.
		</p>
		<p>
			We all love Wikipedia right? Well never cite it. On every Wikipedia page at the bottom there will be sources, go to those instead.
			Wikipedia is a great place to start but all information there is second hand, so go to the source. Going to the source directly will
			help on cutting out bias from the page writer.
		<p>
			"But Wikipedia has editors to find wrong or bias information!"<br>
			Yes, they do, but they aren't perfect. Wikipedia is a huge website, the editors will miss things.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cutting out the middleman will generally make your information more correct.
			Have you ever played "telephone?" Then you know exactly whats its like to try to accurately convey an idea through multiple middlemen.
